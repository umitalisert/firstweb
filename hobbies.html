    <p>When I was in high school and college, I remember feeling bored. The world was wide open with possibilities of creating and recreating myself. Yet, everything good in life seemed to be ahead of me. I was always waiting for that good part.

This past year living in NYC was a challenge. Even though we feel fulfilled in our careers, we had a hard time drawing boundaries between work and life. Since travel, our hobby, became our work, it almost became impossible to distinguish where to draw the line.</p>
